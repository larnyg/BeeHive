# BeeHive
Developing electronic control of beehives

This project's goal is to control and manage beehives with IOT technology.

In step 1 we work to develope collecting data functionality and equipment based on the Langstroth beehive standard.  We also will make some additional equipment for use of simple collecting functions for the "Norwegian Standard Beehives".  We recomend beekeepers to establish some beehives using the Langstroth standard (exactly the Finish equipment from Paradise Honey).

The solution will have a very modulary arcitecture and it shall be possible to handle different parallell solutions in the project.
